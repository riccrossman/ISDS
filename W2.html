<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >This worksheet has two aims - to give you your first experience of working in a
team, and to strengthen your skills with writing functions in <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">R</span>. These two aims
will be achieved through your group working together to produce one or more
short games, playable using <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">R</span>.
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" ><span

<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >I showed you how the <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">while </span>and <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">for </span>functions worked earlier in the workshop,
bt here is a little more information on them which you might find useful when
designing your game.

        <!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >The function <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">for </span>performs an operation a number of times; the number
        of times has to be specified. We specify through the use of a counter,
        often but not necessarily denoted <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">i</span>. We refer to this process as &#8220;a <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">for</span>
     loop&#8221;. If we try:
        <!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" ><span

   <!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >we get a value <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">a</span>, initially equal to 0, but then has the values 1, 2, 3,...
        10 added to it, for a total of 55. In contrast, if we try

   <!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >we&#8217;ll get a value for <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">a </span>of 10. This is because <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">i </span>is not contained in the
        <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">for </span>loop. <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">R </span>still knows how many times you want the loop to run for,
        though, so it still does what you ask it to 10 times.

        it runs loops for us. The big difference is that the <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">for </span>function needs
        you to specify in advance how many loops to run. The <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">while </span>function
        will keep running loops so long as a given property holds.

     the <span

<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >Okay! It&#8217;s time to design a game. I&#8217;ll start this section by explaining what I want
each group to produce, and after that, I&#8217;ve given some examples of code you can
use to construct a game to play in the Workshop 2 folder on Ultra - feel free to
use parts of this code in your own game. I&#8217;ll leave it up to each group as to how
simple or complicated you want your game to be. Bear in mind the benefits of
starting with something simple and making it more complicated once you&#8217;re sure
the simple version works!
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >There are three primary components to produce in this exercise:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7x1">
     <!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >A name for your game.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-9x2">
     <!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >A word-processed document which gives the rules to the game.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-11x3">
     <!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">R </span>code to be used in playing the game. The game does not have to
     be completely playable in <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">R </span>(the first example I give below just uses <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">R</span>
     to generate dice rolls), but at least some part of your game should be
     playable using <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">R </span>code that you have written.</li></ol>
<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >It is up to your group to decide what the game involves, how complicated to
make it, whether it should come in multiple stages (perhaps modular
programming would be a good idea here). While this is a good opportunity to
apply what you&#8217;ve learned so far about <span 
class="cmtt-10x-x-109">R</span>, the primary focus of this task is taking
your first steps in learning to work together. Discuss the task, and come to an
agreement on what you want to try. Decide who will participate in each
task and how, and how to keep each other informed of how things are
going.
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >Remember what we just learned about teams vs groups. Will each of you have a
different task, or will some/all tasks be done together? Do you want
more than one person attempting to code something, so they can help
each other, or are people going to work on different parts of code, in
order to bring it together at the end. What will you do if someone gets
stuck?
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >I won&#8217;t be asking you to submit your game, but I <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">will </span>be releasing a short
reflective exercise at 6pm today for you to go through. This exercise will not be
for credit, but it is an expectation that you complete the exercise before the next
workshop on 19.10.23.
