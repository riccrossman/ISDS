class="cmbx-10x-x-109">The Binomial Coefficient</span>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >One of the ideas introduced in the Week 3 videos is the binomial coefficient. I
said in Video 3.3 that I would explain how these values work in a separate place,
since you don&#8217;t technically need to know how they work in order to make use of
them.
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >That said, I do think the way they work is quite interesting, hence this document
that you&#8217;re reading now!
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >A quick reminder of how we used binomial coefficients. This was in the context of
a binomial distribution. The binomial distribution has two parameters <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p </span>and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>,
and represents the number of trials, out of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>, that have been in some way
&#8220;successful&#8221;. The assumptions we need in order to use the binomial distribution
are:
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-3x1">
     <!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >Each trial either succeeds or fails;
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5x2">
     <!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >Each trial has the same probability <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p </span>of success;
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7x3">
     <!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Each trial result is independent of all other trials.</li></ol>
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Under these assumptions, we went through how the probability of getting <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>
sucesses and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>failures in our series of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span>trials must equal the probability of
getting <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>successes in a row followed by <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">-</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>failures in a row, multiplied by the
number of different ways you can actually order <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>successful trials and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>
failed trials. For example, if I toss a coin, which has probability <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p </span>the coin lands
heads-side up, then the probability I get two heads and one tails in three tosses
equals the probability of getting two heads then one tails (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>(1 <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p</span>)),
multiplied by the number of ways we can get two heads and one tails in three
tosses. There are three such combinations, HHT, HTH, THH, so the overall
probability is 3<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p</span><sup><span 
class="cmr-8">2</span></sup>(1 <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p</span>).
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >The binomial coefficient gives us the number of different ways we can arrange <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>
successes and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>failures into a sequence of lengh <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>. The way it does this is
quite simple, but quite clever. First of all, how many ways are there of arranging

<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">different </span>objects in a sequence? Well, we have n choices for the object starting
the sequence, and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span>1 choices for the second object. This means we have
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span>1) possibilities for what the first two objects in the sequence can be;
each of the <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span>choices for what comes first then gives us <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span>1 choices for what
comes second. Note that here we are assuming that swapping round the first two
objects crates a new possible beginning - we&#8217;ll come back to this very soon.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >By extending this logic, we have that there <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span>1) <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span>2) possibilities for
the first three objects in the sequence, and so on. We keep on making choices
from the objects left, until eventually we have 2 choices for the penultimate
object, and only 1 choice for what comes last. Overall, then, the number of ways
we can order <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span>different objects is <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span>1) <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span>2) <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7;</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x2026;</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>2 <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x00D7; </span>1, which we&#8217;ve
described before as <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span>factorial, denoted <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>!.
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >That&#8217;s how many ways we can arrange <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span>different objects, then. That, though,
isn&#8217;t the situation we&#8217;re in. We don&#8217;t have <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span>different objects, we have one set of
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>identical objects, and a second set of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>identical objects. We&#8217;ve just seen
there are <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>! different ways to arrange <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>objects, but all of them would be the
same in this case. That&#8217;s not a problem, though. We know we have <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>!
combinations of objects, but that we can divide those combinations into groups
of size <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>!, where each of the combinations in the group is actually identical,
because they differ only in which successes go where, and all successes are the
same.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >If we divide <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>! by <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>!, then, we get the actual number of orderings of our
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>! objects which are actually <span 
class="cmbx-10x-x-109">different </span>in terms of the placement of
successes.
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >We can then make exactly the same argument for the failures. There are <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">-</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>of
those, each of them identical, so we can divide our orderings into groups of size
(<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">- </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>)!, with each ordering in a group having the same placement of failures.
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Overall, then, we find the number of actually distinct orderings of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>successes
and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">-</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>failures by taking <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>! and dividing it by both <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>! and (<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span><span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">-</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>)!. But that
is precisely how I defined the binomial coefficient:
<div class="eqnarray">
<div class="math-display" >
<img 
src="BC0x.png" alt="(n )       n!
  x  = x!(n---x)!
" class="math-display" ></div>
</div>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >And there you have it: why the binomial coefficient has the definition it does. If
you want to learn more about binomial coefficients, you can look up what is
commonly known as &#8220;Pascal&#8217;s triangle&#8221;, which uses a triangular structure to
build up successive rows of binomial coefficients. Alternatively/additionally, look
up Al-Karaji, the Persian mathematician who first wrote down what
we now call &#8220;Pascal&#8217;s triangle&#8221;, more than 600 years before Pascal was
born!
